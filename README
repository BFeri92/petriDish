PetriDish

PetriDish is a simple evolutionary game based on
neuroevolution algorithms. Agents are created with
random weights in their neural networks defining
a random behavior, the most fit agents (those who
was alive for the longest time) will define the
base of the next generation. Ideally, after some 
time, the agents will collect food more efficiently.
